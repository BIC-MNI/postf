.SH NAME
.B postf
a medical image display utility.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B postf
.I [filename] [-title <window-title] [-debug] [-noprogress]
.I [-cindex <min> <max>] [-frames <n>] [-frame <n>] [-rframes <min> <max>]
.I [-slices <n>] [-rslices <min> <max>] [-width <n>] [-height <n>] 
.I [-roi_radius <r>] [-dynamic] [-images <n>] 
.I [-spectral | -hotmetal | -grayscale] [-describe] [-help] [-version]

.SH DESCRIPTION 

The program 
.B postf
displays slices through a static or dynamic volume of
images. It will read data from both minc and mni format files,
automatically detecting the file type. If no file name is given, then
raw single-precision floating point values are read from standard
input. To obtain information on command-line arguments, invoke 
.B postf
with the 
.I -help
option.

.B postf
does not have a conventional user-interface.  Instead,
operations are invoked by simple key presses and mouse motion. These
commands are described below. Note that there are two areas of the
window that can behave slightly differently: the image area and the
colour-bar area - these differences are noted in the command
descriptions.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.BI -title " window-title"
Set the title of the main window.  The default title is the name of the
file specified on the command line.
.TP 
.BI -cindex " min max"
Set minimum and maximum colour lookup table indices.  The defaults are 64
and 255.
.TP
.BI -frames " n"
Set the number of dynamic data frames.
.TP
.BI -frame " n"
Display frame 
.IR n " initially."
.TP
.BI -rframes " min max"
Read in frames from 
.IR "min " "through " "max " only.
.TP
.BI -slices " n"
Set the number of data slices to 
.IR n .
.TP
.BI -slice " n"
Display slice 
.IR "n " initially.
.TP
.BI -rslices " min max"
Read in slices from 
.IR "min " "through " "max " only.
.TP
.BI -width " n"
Set the width of the image to 
.IR n .
.TP
.BI -height " n"
Set the height of the image to 
.IR n .
.TP
.BI -roi_radius " r"
Set the initial region of interest radius to 
.IR "r " voxels.
.TP
.B -dynamic
Time information is available within float data stream.
.TP
.BI -images " n"
Number of images in float data stream.
.TP
.B -spectral
Use spectral colour map.
.TP
.B -hotmetal
Use hotmetal colour map.
.TP
.B -grayscale
Use grayscale colour map.
.TP
.B -describe
Print user interface description.
.TP
.B -debug
Output MINC file information.
.TP
.B -noprogress
Do not print progress information during MINC image input.
.TP
.B -help
Print summary of command-line options and exit.
.TP
.B -version
Print the program's version number and exit.

.SH USER INTERFACE 

The visible user interface of the program consists of three possible
windows: the main window, the time-activity popup, and the activity
cross section popup.  When the program is started, only the main window
is displayed initially.

The main window consists of two main parts, the large slice image display on
the left side of the window, and the colour bar and position information
displayed on the right side of the window.  The information displayed
along with the color bar includes the following:
.TP
.BI x= n
The current x position of the cursor, in voxel coordinates
.TP
.BI y= n
The current y position of the cursor, in voxel coordinates
.TP
.BI v= n
The value of the voxel at the current cursor position
.TP
.BI a= n
The area of the region of interest, in voxels.
.TP
.BI f: " n"
The current frame number
.TP
.BI s: " n"
The current slice number

.SH Mouse 
.TP 
.B left mouse button
When the mouse cursor is in the slice image: Evaluate (and move) current
pixel.  When the mouse cursor is in the colour bar: Move top of colour
bar.
.TP
.B middle mouse button
When the mouse cursor is in the slice image: Move whole image in
viewport When the mouse cursor is in the colour bar: Move top and bottom
of colour bar together.
.TP
.B right mouse button
When the mouse cursor is in the colour bar: move bottom of colour bar.
.TP
.B left and right mouse buttons
When the mouse cursor is in the slice image: Print time-activity curve
for the current pixel on the standard output. This feature is only 
functional when the time-activity pop-up window is displayed.
